https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/1YYMr0eNHOzy29K4qldC4E59h-ukSnGuc?pli=1This is a simple car dodging game created using MIT Scratch.
The player controls a car that can move between three lanes on the road. Enemy cars come from the opposite direction and move towards the player.
The main goal of the game is to avoid hitting the enemy cars by changing lanes at the right time using the keyboard.
If the player’s car touches any enemy car, the game shows “Game Over” and restarts.
